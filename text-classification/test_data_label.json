He also has HFrEF(2016-07-27: EF 28%); Afib; VHD(MR); Hypertension; Hyperlipidemia; Gout; CKD, stage 3 (Cr 1.5~1.9 mg/dl); PUD.   He receied regular medical control at our hospital. Echocardiography on 2016/07/27 revealed dilated LV, EF 28%, global hypokinesia, akinesia at anteroseptal/anterior wall and apex. Thallium-201 scan on 2016/8/16 showed  (1) marked dilated LV with poor systolic function, (2) mixed viable and nonviable myocardium in the apex, apical-to-mid anterior wall.   This time, he suffered from dyspnea and decreased urine output for days. He denied orthropnea, dyspnea on exertion, limbs edema, productive cough, rhinorrhea. He was brought to our ED. Inita vital sign showed 36.7C, 123bpm, 22/min, 137/87 mmHg. EKG showed Af, no STE. Chest film showed cardiomegaly and bilateral infiltration. The laboratory finding showed creatinine 2.17 mg/dL, TROPONIN-T 128.4 ng/L, NT-ProBNP 32675 pg/mL. Echocardiography on 2017/09/25 revealed global hypokinesia, esp over LAD territory; moderate-severe eccentric MR, mild to moderate TR, dilated LA & LV, LV contractility impairement, mild, probable moderate pulmonary hypertension.

HPI:  This is a 69-year-old male patient who denied of underlying conditions of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or dyslipidemia. He used to be a smoker (5~6 cigarettes per day), betel nut user (10~15 per day), and a heavy drinker (2~3 cups of strong alcohols such as 高粱 and whisky or half a dozen of beer per day) for over 10 years but had quit all of them for about 20 years. He had chest tightness a few years ago and had underwent Thallium scan on 2015/07/08, revealing probable mild stress-induced ischemia at inferolateral wall, preserved LV systolic function, rest LVEF=66%, and mild lung congestion and RV overload. The symptom improved after Aspirin use and the patient ceased medication after a few doses and lost of follow up. He also has the past history of several fall down accidents at the construction fields with various injuries and varicose in bilateral lower legs which he had seeked medical treatment 4~5 years ago. This time,the patient experienced chest pain while he was travelling in 青藏高原. He awoke from sleep due to the pain and shortness of breath was noted while walking.Th symptom relieved after three respective doses of nitroglycerin. There was no pain radiation nor cold sweating. Under his friends' advice, he came to the CV OPD for check up. Another Thallium scan was arranged and probable chronic CAD with collaterals at apex, inferior and inferolateral wall, fair LV systolic function, and mild RV overload was found. Comparing to prior study on 2016-07-26, no significant change of post-stress hypoperfused region at inferior and inferolateral wall. He was then informed by the doctor of the possible progression of the condition and suggested for hospitalization for further examination. However, the patient experienced another attack 3 days prior to the admission. There was the symptom of dull chest discomfort, yet pain radiation and cold sweating were absent and that the symptom only lasted for a few minutes. It occurred in the morning after he had breakfast and had been a while after his routined morning exercise. The symptom relieved spontaneously without any measures taken.   Upon bedside approach, the patient was alert and at ease with no sign of discomfort. The vital signs were stable, with body temperature 36.3, blood pressure 120/76 mmHg, pulse rate 60 bpm, and respiratory rate 20 /min. There was regular heart beat with no significantly audible murmur. Th breathing sound was clear in all lung fields and there was no wheezing, rhonchi, nor basal rales. The peripheral pulses were strong and the Allen's test result was normal bilaterally while the left side had a circulation  slightly poorer to the right. The abdomen was distended due to examination shortly after meal. No change in the habit of urination or defecation was noted by the patient. Suspecting progression in his coronary artery disease condition, the patient was admitted for pre-operational survey and cardiac catheterization was arranged for further coronary artery condition assessment.

He also had orthopnea with wheezing, insomnia, muscle twitching, and poor appetite recently. Dyspnea progressed even on rest yesterday, so he went to a LMD and received one bag of injection. However, the symptoms did not improve. He did not have fever or chest pain. He nearly fell in this morning. Therefore, he was brought to our emergency department today.On the arrival of triage, vital signs were BP 81/53 mmHg, HR 62 /min, RR 20 /min, BT 35.4 ℃, Sp02 96%, GCS 15. Muscle twitching was noted. Suddenly loss of consciousness happened at 11:57, so we started CPR for 5 minutes. Initial rhythm was PEA. Endotracheal intubation was done. ROSC happened at 12:02. Lab data before CPR revealed severe hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated cardiac enzymes. ECG showed ST elevation at avR, diffuse ST depression, and widening QRS. Bedside TTE showed LVEF ~60% without regional wall motion abnormality. Cardiologist was consulted and suggested shifting aspirin to plavix and considering CAG after electrolyte was corrected.

Grossly, they are tan-red and elastic. All for section. MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Microscopically, sections show an exoendophytic squamoproliferative lesion revealing high-grade (severe) dysplasia in places. Besides, there are foci of compact to confluent projections of atypical squamous cells embedded in the somewhat altered stroma, indicating stromal invasion (i.e., moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma). The size of invasion is at least 5 mm in width and 2 mm in depth on the basis of this specimen.

After taking drug from our CV OPD on 2017/3/20,he had painless hematuria. He turned to our urology OPD.Hematuria was subsided after PRADAXA switched from QD to QOD. However, urology sono found a bladder tumor and arranged him to remove it by surgery on 4/24.He also went to ECKH for second opinion in April.Both hospital's anesthesiologist suggested him to postpone the surgery due to bradycardia.Therefore,he came to our CV OPD on 5/1 for help and we arrange 24-hour holter for further evaluation.  24-hour holter showed heart ranged from 30bpm to 112bpm. His atrial fibrillation was found 99.5%. One triplet event and two couplet events was revealed.     This time he was found lethargy at home by his wife at 10:00 on 2017/5/10. She can't wake him up and immediately sent him to our ER. At ER, his saturation and vital sign was stable ,and no specific finding about his lab data. According to patient himself, he took medicine from LMD to ease his knee pain before he feel lethargic. He was admitted to our ward on 2017/5/10.   He had no chest pain, tightness, and dyspnea. Mild discomfort was noted at his left chest intermittently without radiation. He can walk about 1~2 km and climb 4  storey high. No more hematuria was noted after his anti-coagulent drug was adjusted at OPD 2017/3/20. He had no dysuria and abdominal pain. No weight change and edema in recent months. He complained knee pain when walking and climbing stairs. Under the impression of atrial fibrillation with SVR, suspect drug side-effect related, further evaluation and treatment will be performed.

From the beginning of June, he started having chest tightness at his left chest on exertion without any radiation pain. He claimed his chest tightness could be relieved via resting and needed no medication. He also had an event of monocular temporal hemianopia at his right eye once for about 5 to 6 minutes in  the same month. He denied other symptom nor discomfort. However,he mentioned the doctor at NTU Hsin-chu branch noticed him that his right internal carotid artery had stenosis of 40% and left internal carotid artery with stenosis of 20%.  During physical exmination, the pulses measured at carotid, femoral, radial,and dorsalis pedis were all normal. No bruit was heard. Heart sound was at regular heart beat without any mumur. His respiratory sound was clear without abnormal breath sound nor dyspnea.No bruit was heard over the abdominal aorta.Under the impression of chest tightness and suspect of restenosis of left anterior descending artery, he was admitted for further evaluation and treatment with catheterization.

According to her family, she had previous CBD stone s/p ERCP complicated with bleeding at 中國醫藥學院 on 2019/12/31.This time, she complained of fever for 1 day. Persistent tarry stool was also noted recently. Thus, she was sent to our ER for help. At ER, lab data showed leukocytosis as WBC=20.65*10^3/μL. HGB showed 8.9 g/dL. CXR revealed bilateral lung pleural effusion. CT showed retro-peritoneum inflammation and abscess, and suspected necrotizing pancreatitis related.Under the impression of post-pancreatitis retro-peritoneum abscess, IV antibiotic treatment was given, and CT guide drainage of abscess will be arranged tomorrow. Furthermore, PES may also be arranged for hemostasis. Conclusively, she was then transferred to SICU for further management and care.

He suffered from a traffic accident with riding motorcycle this afternoon. He was brought to New Taipei city hospital(三重院區) ER by EMT. The patient had no fever, cough or any other discomfort symptoms recently. He also has no TOCC history. At the ER, patient's consciousness coma, GCS: E1M3-4V1, dilated pupil and absent Doll/s eye and light reflex. Intubation was performed to protect airway. Whole body CT was done which revealed diffuse SAH, bilateral SDH and contusion, hypoxia change and brain stem hemorrhage. Bilateral lung contusion and hemothorax was also noted. Then he was transferred to our ER at 19:05. NE revealed GCS: E1M3-4V1, dilated pupil and absent Doll/s eye and light reflex, and repeated whole body CT showed 1. traumatic brain injury with SAH and SDH; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and central herniation, 2. Traumatic lung contusion injury in the both lower lobes and right middle lobe, 3. Laceration injury of the liver cannot be excluded; No obvious hemoperitoneum is found, 4. Fracture of the left transverse process of the L1 vertebra. The Neurosurgery specialist was consulted, grave prognosis due to enlarged hypoxia area and brain stem hemorrhage, I have discussed with his family about the very poor outcome and they decided palliative treatment and consider DNR. Due to above reason, he was admitted for further care.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: History 1: [Department: Neurosurgery Admission Diagnosis: 1.

By her description, Concor was started from 4-5 years ago, then Imdur and Pitavastatin were started from 2 years ago. She found she had low blood pressure after taking these medicines and then stop taking them last years.She started to had shortness of breath after walking for long distance in 2017. She had one syncope last September (2017/9) while she visited Japan. She described that she had shortness of breath after walking too fast and then lost of consciousness and collapsed for 3 mins without anal and urinary incontinence happening. Associated symptom was intermittent chest pain, which was similar to her gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Her chest pain did not radiate to her back and left shoulder. She did not have cold sweating neither. She did not have any other underlying systemic diseases. She then went back to 中山 hospital, where she was treated for her hypertension, for help and 2D cardiac echo done there showed aortic valvular heart disease. She also visited local medical department due to her sleeping problem and was prescribed with Xanax and Ativan.  At that time, she was recommended to go to 三總 hospital for further examination, which was arranged in this May. Due to her aggravated shortness of breath, she came to 亞東 hospital's outpatient department for help. On 2018/3/29, Cardiac echo revealed severe aortic stenosis (AVA =0.49cm2, VTI Max/ Mean PG =107/ 62 mmHg) with normal left ventricular contractility (LVEF : 64% by M-mode). In addition, LV concentric hypertrophy was also found. Electrocardiography on 2018/3/26 also showed left ventricular hypertrophy with inverted T wave at lead II, III, aVF, V3~V6.After consultation, she decided to have surgery and was admitted on 2018/4/26 for cardiac catheterization for pre-operation evaluation.

This time, the patient complained of shortness of breath when exercising. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, cold sweating were also noticed. Traced back to his history, the patient said he had both side shoulders pain, arms pain and neck pain with chest tightness one year ago. The patient denied dizzy, headache, decreased urine output, nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain. In recent 10 days, the shortness of breath got more severe, so the patient went to FEMH clinics for help. Physical examination showed bilateral wheezing breathing sound and bilateral legs pitting edema. Lab data showed elevated NT-ProBNP(3121pg/mL). CXR showed pulmonary edema. EKG showed RBBB. Cardiac echo showed LVEF: 42%, apex thrombus from precordiall views(1*1.35cm2), LV regional wall motion abnormality with apical akinesia, moderate MR, TR, and probable severe pulmonary hypertension. Besides, elevated troponin was also noted. Thus he underwent the cardiac catheterization, which showed CAD 3vd SYNTAX 51; RCA: p-70% m-100% ( bridging collateral/LCA --＞ TIMI 2 flow of distal RCA ); LAD (p-70% on Spiderview., m-100% Dx 99%); LCx p-90% m-90% d-100% OMx 99%) ; UCG showed LVEF around 20% MR+++ AR+-++Apical mural clot 1.7x 1.9 cm; LV/AO was not done due to LV thrombosis.

PATHOLOGY REPORT: 2020/10/09Bone marrow, biopsy, compatible with acute lymphocytic leukemiaThe specimen submitted consists of five tissue fragments, measuring up to 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm in size, fixed in formalin.Grossly, they are red and fragmented. Histological processing was done after decalcifying.All for section.Microscopically, sections show hypercellular marrow with cellularity about 95%, which is composed of almost entirely small-to-medium-sized blastoid cells with scant cytoplasm and delicate chromatin. Frequent apoptosis and mitotic activity are also noted. Normal hematopoietic elements and megakaryocytes are markedly decreased in amount, mostly replaced by immature cells. Immunohistochemically, these blastoid cells are positive for TdT. Only scant cells are positive for CD3 and CD20. The picture is compatible with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Suggest correlating with clinical findings, bone marrow smear and flow cytometry.2020/11/09No cell.

Since last discharge in 2022/06, according to his family's statement, he experienced lower blood pressure and intermittent twitch after Herpes zoster infection 3 weeks ago. He experienced general weakness and dyspnea on exertion after last discharge. Due to weakness, he ate orally by feeding at lying position but no obvious chocking episodes was observed. Upper limbs edema was also noted for 1 week. This time, he experienced shortness of breath followed by choking episode on 2022/11/06 when feeding (稀飯) under lying position. Loss of consciousness was observed about 10 mins later. There was no fever, chills, cough with sputum, chest pain, orthopnea, decreased urine output, legs edema, nor tarry stool. EMT was called and SpO2 40-50% was observed at the scene. NRM was used and he was brought to ED for help.At triage, SpO2 93% and hypothermia were noted under NRM. Physical examination showed bilateral coarse breathing sound. EKG showed Af without ST-Tchange. CXR showed lung edema with bilateral pleural effusion. Lab data showed leukocytosis (13.3110^3/μL) with neutrophil predominance, respiratory acidosis (PCO2 62.7 mmHg, pH 7.208) and hypoalbuminemia (Alb 1.5 g/dL). HFNC was used and levophed pump was added for shock. NG tube was inserted for difficulty in swallowing. Bedside echo showed massive pleural effusion, thus right chest pigtial insertion was performed and follow-up CXR showed improving right pleural effusion. Self-paid albumin was given.

She had urine leakage when cough for years. In addition, she had urinary frequency (> 8 times/day) and nocturia (> 2 times/night). Therefore, she came to our OPD for help. PV exam showed cystocele stage II and rectocele stage II, as well as positive cough stress test. Urodynamic study showed detrusor overactivity and stress incontinence. Therefore, she was admitted for surgical intervention. However, during pre-op exam, lab data showed abnormal liver function tests (AST: 790 U/L, ALT: 842 U/L). Viral hepatitis survey was performed, which showed negative findings (Anti-HAV IgM (-), HBsAg (-), Anti-HBc (-), Anti-HCV (-)). She mentioned she had sudden epigastric pain (VAS: 7) the day before admission, which radiated to the back, but subsided after a few hours. She did not have much GI discomforts upon admission (VAS: 1). She denied taking any drugs, herbal medicine or drinking alcohol. She said she had few sleep recently (2-4 hr/day). Physical exam showed soft and flat abdomen, with no tenderness. Due to abnormal liver function tests, her surgery for urinary incontinence was postponed, and GI sono exam was arranged. We would consult GI specialist for further management.

PATHOLOGY REPORT: 2020/08/06Mediastinum, biopsy, epithelial malignancyThe specimen submitted consists of 3 tissue fragments measuring up to 0.5 x 0.1 x 0.1 cm in size, fixed in formalin.Grossly, they are yellow and soft.All for section.Microscopically, it shows aggregates of ovoid-to-spindle neoplastic cells separated by fibrous stroma. Nuclear atypia is mild-to-moderate. Scattered mitoses are seen. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells are positive for CK, p63 and TTF-1 stains, but negative for synaptophysin and CD117 stains. CD5 stain highlights some intra-tumoral T-lymphocytes.After discussing with departmental colleagues, an epithelial malignancy is suggested, and a thymic-origin neoplasm (probably a type A thymoma) should be considered first. A pulmonary-origin malignancy, also included in the differential diagnosis, is less favored. Clinical correlation is recommended.

HPI: A 33-year-old woman, gravida-2 para-0 artificial abortion-1, at 30 weeks' gestaional age, LMP: 2015 mid August, EDC:2016/5/24, presented with hypertension noted on prenatal check-up.Last year, she underwent artificial abortion in 2015 February because of thick nuchal translucency and chromosomal defect (47,XYY, t(1;8)(q23.3;q22.3),r(13)(p13q34)) on chorionic villus sampling. She was found to be pregnant again in 2015 October at GA 6 weeks. Subsequent amniocentesis at GA 17 weeks reported normal chromosomal pattern (46 XX). Gestational hypertension was noted at GA 20 weeks and was controlled by oral apresoline 10 mg 1# Tid at our hospital. Hepatitis B and Syphillis - negative.  However, severe hypertension was noted (200/121 mmHg) on 2016/3/18 at our antenatal clinic so she was transferred to emergency department. She denied headache, blurred vision, abdominal pain, seizures or other specific discomfort. Laboratory study revealed mild anemia, normal platelet count, mildly elevated LDH and normal renal and liver function while urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria. The diagnosis of preeclampsia with severe features was made. Bethamethasone were administered for fetal lungs maturity and control her high blood pressure with Intravenous Tandate and oral Hydralazine 10mg 2# Q6H. She was then transferred to 4D obstetric ward for blood pressure control and further management.

HPI: This 62 y/o man, with PH of: previous stroke this early year, HTN under anti-HTN, prostate disease s/p with medication. He suffered from acute right limbs weakness, dizziness and slurred speech at 2019/08/20 21:00. He denied fever, trauma, headache, diplopia, dizziness. He was sent to 樹林仁愛H initially, CT of brain showed no ICH and IV-tPA was suggested. He was transferred to our ER at 2019/08/20 22:43 for further management. At ER, right central facial palsy, slurred speech, MP: 4/5/3/5 were noted. Brain CT/CTA report: 1. Several small low densities over bilateral basal ganglion regions, could be old or recent lacunar infarcts. Suggest clinical correlation. 2. Enlarged sellar with a soft tissue density nodular lesion and calcification, size about 1.4 cm, suspicious pituitary macroadenoma. Neuorologist was consulted, NIHSS: 6/42. IV-tPA was NOT indicated due to: 1) intracranial tumor;  IA thrombectomy is NOT indicated due to NO large artery occlusion (by Neuroradiologist Dr. W-J Lai).  Brain MRI with/without contrast was performed and showed: 1. Tiny diffusion restricted foci in the left deep temporal and temporo-occipital junction. Water-shed infarct is suspected. 2. A 1.7*1.6*1.4cm pituitary macroadenoma. 3. Old lacunar infarcts in the bilateral corona radiata and basal ganglia. 4. Suspect tight stenosis or occlusion of the bilateral MCA bifurcation, longer segment of stenosis/thrombosis of the left M1/2. Neurosurgeon was consulted and suggest NS OPD follow-up (Dr.李振豪) for pituitary macroadenoma after discharge.

FDG PET for regional and whole body disease evaluation, for further treatment plan. NUCLEAR MEDICINE STUDY: Whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET/CT).  RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: F-18 FDG (Fluoro-deoxy-glucose) 7.01 mCi intravenous.PATIENT'S RESPONSE: nil.SCINTIGRAPHIC FINDINGS:    Whole body PET/CT was performed from skull to upper thigh at 40 minutes after iv. injection of 2-[Fluorine-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) by GE Discovery VCT PET/CT scanner. Prior fasting for 6 hours. The blood glucose level was 97 mg/dl. Non-diagnostic CT without contrast for attenuation correction and localization. The computer reconstructed transaxial, coronal, and sagittal images.    Analysis of the images showed:1. Mild focal uptake at the left breast cancer (fig 07, SUVmax=4.3), and lymph nodes at left axilla level II (fig 08, SUVmax=1.5). Some other iso-metabolic nodes  at left axilla level I-II (fig 09, SUVmax=1.2). 2. Marked enlarge left thyroid nodule with hypometabolic cystic change, and focal uptake at lower region with calcification (fig 10-12, SUVmax=23.8). 3. Intense uptake of the lung patches at bilateral upper lung region (fig 13-14, SUVmax=10.2).4. Diffuse heterogeneous hypermetabolism of whole skeleton (fig 15, SUVmax=4.0). 5. Coronary calcification (fig 16).* SUVmax : maximal Standard Uptake Value.1. Viable left breast cancer, with nodal metastases at left axilla level I-II. 2. Focal FDG-avid lesion at left thyroid lower part, with marked cystic change at left neck, DDx: thyroid cancer, toxic goiter, or adenoma. Suggest tissue proof for etiology. 3. Probable active inflammation/infection process at bilateral upper lung, DDx: mixed with lung metastases cannot be excluded. Suggest clinical and other studies correlation, tissue proof if indicated.  4. Diffuse bone marrow involvement. 5. Coronary calcification, CV risk evaluation for anti-cancer therapy if needed. Tentative stage of AJCC, 8th edition for breast cancer by FDG PET: Tx N1-2 M1. Recommend correlation with clinical information and other studies. Note:* Inflammatory activity or infectious process uptakes FDG, producing False-positive. * Not all kinds of tumor or cancer cells uptake FDG; subcentimeter lesion could be below the resolution of PET scanner, false-negative could occur.

Brain image including Brain CTA, MRI were done due to headache and R/O DAA.Brain CT showed 1.No intracranial hemorrhage, loss of grey-white differentiation or space-taking lesion. 2.Hyperdensity in the distal BA on the right side. (Se=2, Im=10, 11) Suspected BA dissection. 3.Hypodense foci at right corona radiata and right lentiform nucleus. Suspected lacunar infarcts, demyelination or enlarged Virchow-Robin spaces. 4.Brain atrophy with leukoaraiosis. Brain MRI showed 1.No image evidence of acute infarct. 2.Compatible with moya-moya syndrome. 3.Brain atrophy with leukoaraiosis. Brain CTA showed cardiomegaly and heart failure with bilateral pleural effusion. Congestive appearance of liver from cardiac condition. Bile sand and cholecystitis. Suspicious subtle pancreatitis. Echocardiography showed dilated LA ,LV,RA,RV, poor LV contractility (LVEF=25.9%), MR, moderate TR, probable severe, PR, mild, pulmonary hypertension. She was arranged OPD F/U on 5/30.

He suffered from intermittent palpitation since 2015. The discomfort mostly lasted for about 10-20 minutes and developed in the morning (8-9 o'clock) with the frequency of 3-4 times a week. It was often accompanied by dyspnea and chest tightness. Therefore, he came to our CV OPD for help. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was diagnosed in 2016/6 by event recorder. He received regular CV OPD follow up. Propafenone was for maintenance of sinus rhythm Bokey 1#QD was prescribed since his CHA2DS2-VASc Score was 1 (Hypertension). However, he still suffered. TEE on 2017/09/04 showed no LA/LAA thrombus. Under the impression of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, he was admitted for EPS and RFCA.After admission, he underwent electrophysiologic study on 2017/09/20.It showed: Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation S/P PV isolation with success (3D Ensite Electroanatomical Mapping and ICE guide). Pleuritic chest pain was complained after ablation. Bedside echocardiography revealed pericardial effusion around 0.5 cm. Lower BP (SBP around 90/ mmHg) was also found. N/S hydration was offered. Acetaminophen and Ultracet were given for syptom relief. Headache, suspected Ultracet related, occurred. Ultracet was then DC. F/U ECG on 2017/9/21 showed normal sinus rhythm. The chest pain gradually subsided. No obvious discomfort was noted on 2017/9/22. He was discharged on 2017/09/22 in walking status under stable condition.No anti-aarhythmic drugs were taken after he was discharged.  He led an uneventful life until 2018/11 when frequent tachycardia and chest tightness attacked. He visited Li-Hsin Hospital on 2018/11/23 due to tachycardia (HR 150 BPM). ECG showed Atrial flutter with variant AV conduction. He visited FEMH CV OPD on 2019/1/14. ECG showed Atrial flutter with variant AV conduction.

He lived at home and had underlying disease of hypertension, under medicine control.According to the patient, he just went through a traffic accident on 2022/08/29 accident. He was the bicyclist and crashed by a car. There was no initial loss of conscious and no head injury. Due to above problem, he was sent to local hospital and left femur fracture was noted. Then, he was referred to our hospital for surgical intervention. Upon Emergency Room, vital signs was stable and saturation was good under room air. His consciousness was clear. Physical examination revealed left hip deformity with limited range of motion and abrasion wounds over left forearm and lower leg. Laboratory test revealed no leukocytosis, normal CRP, electrolyte , liver and renal function. Chest Xray disclosed mild bilateral interstitial infiltration and left femur Xray showed femur intertrochanteric fracture. EKG was sinus rhythm. Orthopedic surgeon was consulted on ER and surgical intervention was suggested. Therefore, cardiac echo as pre-operation survey was done and it showed good cardiac contractility. However, his PCR Ct level was 37.09 and acute COVID-19 couldn't be excluded. Therefore, he was transferred to quarantine ward first.At bedside, he mentioned left thigh pain and mild increase rhinorrhea and sputum since last week, but there was no fever, coughing, dyspnea, diarrhea, dysuria, nause, vomit and headache. His wife was diagnosed as COVID-19 3~4 months ago.
